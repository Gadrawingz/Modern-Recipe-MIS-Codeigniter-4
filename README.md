# Modern Recipe Management Information System Using CI 4

## What is RECIPE

It is a set of instructions telling you (describes) how to prepare or make something(cook food), especially a dish of certain food, drink, including a list of what food is needed for this action.



## What is the purpose of a recipe?

The main purpose of this recipe is to have a precise record of the ingredients used, 
the amounts needed, and the way they are combined by using our created web application.


## What, Why is CodeIgniter?

CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible and secure.
it has been chosen to be used while developing this *recipe* application because it is the easy and good for people who build web sites using PHP. 



## Codeigniter goal

The main goal was to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task.



## Why did I chose Codeigniter for this project?

I chose this toolkit because it is a framework with a small footprint, requires nearly zero configuration, does not require you to use the command line, and again it does not require you to adhere to restrictive coding rules. Additionally I chose it because I need an exceptional performance and interested in large-scale monolithic libraries like PEAR.
